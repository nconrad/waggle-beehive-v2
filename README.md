# Beehive V2

*These notes are a work in progress, as Beehive V2 is under rapid development.*

Beehive server provides the data and management pipeline for Waggle nodes. This repo contains
tools and configs to help deploy a Beehive server.

The quickest way to deploy a Beehive server for dev/test is to:
1. Setup a Kubernetes cluster. For simpler deployment, take a look at tools like [k3s](https://k3s.io) or [Kubespray](https://kubespray.io/).
2. Run the `create-beehive.sh` script.
